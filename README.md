# Punch

A simple CLI punchcard application

## TODO

- [ ] add tests
- [ ] add `mockgen -source=pkg/repositories/interfaces.go -destination=tests/mock.go -package=tests` to the pre-commit hook
- [ ] add github actions with linters and cool stuff like that
- [ ] write a complete readme with guides
- [ ] better ux for cli (sessions and clients are not the same, less kubectl-like)
